# pos-3713-redux
 A streamlined set of class notes for POS-3713


## Histograms: [`histograms-master.rmd`](https://github.com/RobLytle/pos-3713-redux/blob/master/histograms-master.Rmd)

### The Goal
The initial aim of this project was to squash together the histograms chapter of FPP with class notes, incorporating `Rstudio` into an explanation of histograms while maintaining brevity.

### The execution
- This has worked *reasonably* well, but brevity has taken a hit. The PDF is right at 10 pages (5 pages printed though!). 

- I am particularly pleased with the second and third set of exercises. Most focus on the substantive implications of the coding portions, and are solidly poli-sci in flavor, challenging students' ability to interpret histograms and use them to generate hypotheses and evaluate claims.

- I am dissatisfied with some of the first exercises, which are a bit more rote, but still test the student's core understanding and intuition about histograms, not (only) their ability to draw them.

### Regrets

- I would rather the first few examples be more substantive. In the future, I'd probably make example histograms by sampling from actual datasets, not just generating noise.

### Reflections

- It is very difficult knowing what can and can't be trimmed when you're writing for an audience who doesn't know more than you.
