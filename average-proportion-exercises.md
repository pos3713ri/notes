As political scientits, we think a lot about trends in partisanship and voting behavior. Going back to *The American Voter*, published in 1950, an individual's partisan identity has seemed to be the dominant factor in determining for whom they cast a vote.

1. Before Looking at the figures below, how do you think partisan trends have shifted since the 1950s? Have people become more, ore less partisan? Why do you think this is?


The figures below are taken from "Partisanship and Voting Behavior, 1952-1996" published in 2000 by Larry Bartels. Figure 1 shows the proportion of survey respondents who identified as a "Weak Partisan" or a "Strong Partisan", as well as those who consider themselves "Independent Leaners" or "Pure independents". An Independent leaner is someone who may not be registered with a party (or does not think of themselves as 'belonging' to either party), but nevertheless consistently supports one party over the other.

1. What proportion of  the sample identified as some kind of partisan in 1952? Is this more or less than in 1996?

1. Assume approximately 10,000 people responded to the survey in each year of the survey. Approximately how many more people considered themselves weak identifiers in 1976 than strong identifiers?

1. Again, assume 10,000 responses in each iteration of the survey: are there more independents in 1996 than partisans? Of the independents, are more "leaners" or "pure"?
