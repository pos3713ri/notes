# Overview

While FPP is a fantastic textbook, it has three shortcomings:

1. The examples are sometimes culturally and chronologically dated.
1. The examples are usually not particularly interesting to political scientists.
1. There is no computation. 

Rob and Carlisle are making an effort to write a more cohesive set of notes that cover the same content, but with modern, political examples and statistical computation.

This is an in-progress effort, so these notes constantly evolve. Eventally, we hope they can replace the textbook, but they cannot at the moment. Instead, we hope these notes helpfully *supplement* the textbook.
